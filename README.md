# The WebLit Core Curriculum README

The purpose of Mozilla’s Core Web Literacy Curriculum is to provide learners with a basic conceptual understanding of how to read, write, and participate on the web. The 14 Core Activities were culled from new as well as remixing existing activities with the goal of aligning with the [Web Literacy Map](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy). 

Developing this core curriculum has truly been a community effort involving staff, volunteer contributors, and allied organizations from around the world. A special shout-out to our web literacy leaders and their respective public library staff: Sherry Lehane, Erin Davis Anderson, Joanna Milner, Melanie Wilson, and Matthew Kopel for all their contributions, as well as Randy MacDonald and Iris Bond Gill. A big thank you to Matt Rogers and Digitalme for making web literacy badges a reality.

#### Spread, Grow, and Improve the Curriculum
We need your help to spread the word on why it's important for people in their everyday lives to have these core skills, and very interested in how the curriculum is being utilized and forked for continuous improvement. 

Here is how you can help:
* Tell us [how and where you're using the curriculum](https://github.com/mozilla/web-lit-core/issues/8); we'd also love to know [what you've learned by using it](https://github.com/mozilla/web-lit-core/issues/9).
* translating into different languages
* remixing for different audiences
* continually improving the curriculum-- see this [list of tasks and modifications](https://github.com/mozilla/web-lit-core/issues) we need help with!

#### Share your Remixes
For anyone remixing and creating own custom version of the curriculum, we encourage you to add your remixes to https://www.mozillapulse.org/issues/web-literacy.

#### Earning Digital Badges
Digitalme through their Open Badges Academy is offering digital badges for the web literacy skills.  If you are interested in earning or having your learners earn badges, see https://www.openbadgeacademy.com/mozilladirectory.  To help you with assessment of badges, we created these [guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19QAgcMiVkkAILcT8PZwohrC5A5Y-eUxEw6FUmsp7zRM/edit) to help organizations and programs that are implementing badging systems and systems for assessing their badges.
