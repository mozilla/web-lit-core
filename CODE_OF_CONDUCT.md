# Open Leadership Map Whitepaper Participation Guidelines

## Code of Conduct

As contributors to the Mozilla Privacy Arcade project, we agree to review and abide by the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/).

## Participation Guidelines

These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:
- Background
- Family status
- Gender
- Gender identity or expression
- Marital status
- Sex
- Sexual orientation
- Native language
- Age
- Ability
- Race and/or ethnicity
- Caste
- National origin
- Socioeconomic status
- Religion
- Geographic location
-Any other dimension of diversity

Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work — from development on Firefox to collaboratively designing curriculum. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.

To work together in an open and efficient way, we also commit to:

- Work as openly as possible with due respect for others' privacy choices and sense of agency.
- Follow the 50/50 rule: for each issue a person raises or for each problem a person identifies, they try to propose a solution, as well.
- Follow the Nth rule: we will try to “speak” or comment only 1/Nth of the time to allow others to speak, where N is the total number of active contributors on the project.
- Avoid using jargon and ask for clarification when we need it.
- Provide feedback in a timely way when invited to do so.
